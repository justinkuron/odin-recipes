        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Penne alla vodka is a pasta dish made with vodka and penne pasta, usually made with heavy cream, crushed tomatoes, onions, and sometimes sausage, pancetta or peas. The recipe became very popular in Italy and in the United States around the 1980s, when it was offered to discotheque customers.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound penne</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 whole medium onion, chopped finely</li>

            <li>1 cup vodka</li>
            <li>One 14-ounce can tomato puree or tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 generous pinch red pepper flakes, plus more if needed</li>
